```

## Findings
- errors

### HTML
- needs meaningful title in head
- wrapped with main tag
- class header - div can be replaced with header tag
- div within header can be replaced with nav
- div with hero image can be better used as img tag
- content div can be better renamed to main
- h3's should be h2's but can be styled to be smaller
- individual dics can use article tags
- benefits can use aside tag
- can remove id and class repeating
- insert footer
- seo class name can be improved to be more descriptive

### CSS
- change class names based on changes in html file
- .header h1 .seo - only need to address by class name by itself
- remove unnused float left and float right classes? or just apply them
- clear floats afterward
- grooped repetitive h2 styling
